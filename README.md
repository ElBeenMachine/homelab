**Hey there, Iâ€™m Ollie...**

This repository contains all my homelab documentation files. Here you'll find notes, setups, and configurations for infrastructure, applications, networking, and more.

## Contribution

As this is my personal homelab documentation, I don't accept any contributions. But feel free to fork this repository and use it for your own homelab.

None of this would be possible without the content produced and maintained by [Christian Lempa](https://christianlempa.de), [Network Chuck](https://www.networkchuck.com), and [Jeff Geerling](https://www.jeffgeerling.com), to name a few. In the space of just under a year, my understanding of DevOps, best practices, and many other useful tools has greatly improved due to the teachings of these content creators.
